# GTFS Data Manager

This is a workflow tool for managing large amounts of GTFS data. It will allow users to manage feeds coming in from many agencies, see if they are valid and can be loaded, see and manage what feeds are about to expire, and deploy feeds to staging and production OpenTripPlanner servers.

It will eventually be integrated with [https://github.com/conveyal/gtfs-editor](GTFS Editor) to provide a complete GTFS workflow tool.
